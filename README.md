# ðŸŸ¢ Java Array Challenges

## 1) Understand array indexing
- **Goal:** Declare a static array of 5 elements and print each element by index.  
- **Hint:** Indexes start at `0`.  
- **Expected Output:**
10
20
30
40
50
  
---

## 2) Print all elements with a for loop
- **Goal:** Iterate through an array and print every element (less repetitive).  
- **Hint:** Use `arr.length`.  

---

## 3) Read a single value from user into an array position
- **Goal:** Practice using `Scanner` and storing input into `arr[0]`.  
- **Hint:** Remember to `import java.util.Scanner;`.  

---

## 4) Fill the whole array from user input
- **Goal:** Ask the user for 5 numbers and store them in an array.  
- **Hint:** Use a `for` loop to read `arr[i]`.  

---

## 5) Compute the sum of array elements
- **Goal:** Add all elements of the array and print the sum.  
- **Hint:** Initialize `sum = 0`, then use `sum += arr[i]`.  

---

## 6) Compute the average
- **Goal:** Use the sum of the array elements to compute the average.  
- **Hint:** Cast to `double` to avoid integer division.  

---

## 7) Find smallest and largest (min & max)
- **Goal:** Scan the array once and track the minimum and maximum values.  
- **Hint:** Start with `min = arr[0]` and `max = arr[0]`, then compare from index `1`.  

---

## 8) Print the array in reverse order
- **Goal:** Print elements from the last index down to `0`.  
- **Hint:** Loop from `arr.length - 1` down to `0`.  

---

## ðŸ“˜ Quick practice plan
- Do **Step 1 â†’ Step 2** to learn indexing and looping.  
- Do **Step 3 â†’ Step 4** to practice `Scanner` + filling arrays.  
- Do **Step 5 â†’ Step 6** for sum & average.  
- Do **Step 7** for min/max.  
- Do **Step 8** for reversing.  

After these, youâ€™ll have everything to solve the **bigger challenges** (reverse array, min/max, sum & average).
